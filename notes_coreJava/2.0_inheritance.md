- with inheritance, child class will by default import all methods of parent class. 
- we can override methods of parent class in child class
- we can introduce new methods in child class. 

- Use @Override whenever overriding method of parent class. This would check if method is properly overridden and not misspelled etc. 

- private methods/variables of parent class will not be accessible in child class. 
- protected methods/variables of parent class will be accessible by child class as well as within same pakcage. 
- not a good practice to override variables. Just try to override methods only.
