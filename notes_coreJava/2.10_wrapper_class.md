- is Java 100% OOP language? No really, as it also contain primitives. 

int i = 7; ==>  i is not object. so it cannot participate in object activities. 

- As a solution to this problem, Java allows you to include primitives in the family of objects by using what are called wrapper clases
- There is a wrapper class for every primitive type in java. 

(Integer)int i = 7;

Primitive type ==> Wrapper class

boolean => Boolean
int => Integer
char => Character
byte => Byte 
short => Short
long => Long 
float => Float 
double => Double

Some important functions in thse wrapper class: 
**valueOf() :** 
              - Each wrapper class will have this static method. 
              - Takes argument as String which will contain data of class  which you want to return. 
              -  So it returns object reference of relative wrapper class

**paarseXxx():**
              - Again its static method. 
              - xxx refers to primitive type
              - returns xxx type value 
              
**xxxValue():**
              - Instance method of wrapper class. Since its not static function so we need to call via object only. 
              - xxx is any primitive type
              - Returns corresponding primitive type.
