- Interfaces don't have method body but just method header. 
- interfaces would be implemented by inheriting class
- use inherits keyword for it. 

- class can implements any number of interfaces sperated by comma
- class can only exterds only one parent class. 

- we cannot instantiate object using Interface name just , it has to be instantiated by implemeting class

- note this code for App.java: 
This also tells one of major use of itnerfaces in java. 
So we can pass diff objects to interface variable and as long these objects are implementing same interface, we can call Interface method implemented by respective object. 

 // Another method where we are passing Info object.Since object cannot be created for Interface so it will by default point to object of implementing class.
    private static void outputInfo(Info info) {
        info.showInfo();  // implementing class object can call inherited methods.
        
    }
    
-  its good practice to design programme by using interface only. 

- Another scenario
When we open Bank account, we look into interrest rates, branches located etc. 
But after we open, we expect some common facilities like deposit, withdraw etc. 
These facilities we can define using interface.
