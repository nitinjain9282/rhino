example: 
src/main/java/collections/main/java/corejava/example_abstract

- we cannot instantiate abstract class object. 
- abstract class will have abstract methods. So in this case we dont want parent class to implement the method but only want child class to implement it. 


Abstract class vs Interface: 
-  In both cases child classs will implements methods of interface or abstract class but in former case when child class extends absract class its much storger implemetnion as chid class will be of parent type. 
- In Abstract class we cna have own method implementation too. 
- child can only extend one parent Abstract class but can implement many interfaces.
