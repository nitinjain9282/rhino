- it just means many shapes 

- if we have child class and parent class( here Plant is Parent class and Tree is child class) Wherever parent class is expected we can pass child class. 
- it's the variable refrence of the class which tells which method to be called.
But it's the object reference to which variable is pointing which will decide which method would be executed - the child method implementation or parent method with same name.Whenever @Override is done then object will always run child method only.
