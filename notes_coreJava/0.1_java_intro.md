**How java programs run ?**

Java programs are written in text as other programs and are converted to binary by javac program

Text *.java ------------javac-----------------> Binary *.class----------JVM(JRE)------>Computer Program
  

These Binary files require JVM to run which is just another layer of computing over existing CPU/memory
We can provide different kinds of JVM for different platforms,different machine architectures and each JVM run Java binaries in same manner irrespective of hardware.
That's why Java is called Platform Independent Language.

Same is not the case with C++ where CPP programs need to be compiled as per the platform its going to run.
