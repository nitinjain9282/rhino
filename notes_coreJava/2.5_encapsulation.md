src/main/java/collections/main/java/corejava/example_encapsulation

- the idea behind encapsulation is to encapsulate inneer working of that class within that class. 
- stop people outside the class to access varialbes of the class but only expose public API - certain method to use from that class. 
-  that's why we create getter and setter methods to get and set value of variable in class. This varialble is declated private so its only avaialble within the class. 


- idea is to make everything private if we can make private. 
- if needed by child class then make it protected. 
- never expose variables of class to other class.
